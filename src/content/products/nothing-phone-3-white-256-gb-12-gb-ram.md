title: Nothing Phone (3) (White, 256 GB)  (12 GB RAM)
description: Transforming the Glyph Interface introduced on Phone (1), Phone (3)
  updates the simple, effective LED strips to create an all-new Glyph Matrix
  that realises the potential of Nothing OS. Standing out in a sea of familiar
  shapes and styles, Phone (3) makes technology fun again, even when it’s face
  down. At the heart of the new Glyph Matrix is the Glyph Display, a custom
  micro-LED disc that transforms the way a phone communicates.

specifications: "Phone (3)’s 50 MP camera system has you covered, whatever the
  situation. It's four high-resolution cameras cover all the bases: a flagship
  primary sensor, an all-seeing ultra-wide lens, a telephoto periscope camera
  with close-up macro focus, and 4K 60fps capture across all its cameras,
  perfect for creators. Thanks to quality hardware and next-level AI-powered
  Truelens Engine 4, whatever the lighting, the Phone (3) gives you the best
  shot. Flipping Phone (3) around, the 50 MP front camera is built for selfies
  and 4K vlogging."
